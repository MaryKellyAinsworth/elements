            <p>You’ve devoted years of your life to communicating and working with creatures like ghosts and spirits, most likely with the aid of magic or extraordinary circumstances. You may study the processes of the body and soul, as well as the nature of afterlife and undeath, to build, or even become, a spiritual bridge. You may serve a god or faith involving the forces of death, lost a loved one who inexplicably returned, or simply have a supernatural gift. However, almost all spirit mediums will also have some training in the studies of magic, theology, biology, as well as some experience with undead creatures and the paranormal. Mediums may be treated with fear and suspicion as they often possess grim personalities, study necromancy, or are magnets of supernatural activity. It can also be a dangerous line of work, involving frightening creatures and constant confrontation of death.</p>

            <p>You can detect a trace left on an area from undead creatures. This does not tell you what kind of undead, CR, or any other details aside from the fact that they have been through or in that area recently (within the day). Additionally, you can tell if someone you’ve spoken or seen the face of has a history of dealing with undead or experienced a recent death in their social circle or family.</p>
